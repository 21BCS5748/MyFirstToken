# MyFirstToken
Sample code repository showcasing token creation, a secure method of authentication for systems and APIs. This code demonstrates best practices and provides a starting point for developers implementing token-based authentication in their applications.
#Description
Token creation involves developing a digital asset on a blockchain network using mapping to define three public variables: token name, abbreviation (abbrev.), and total supply. Mapping allows efficient access and retrieval of information. These variables represent the token's name, abbreviation, and maximum supply. This approach provides transparency and flexibility for managing the token within the blockchain ecosystem.
